    <p>Viewing Your Work in the Browser
        While working through these assignments, your general workflow should center on writing code in the text editor and periodically running the test suite in the terminal to check your work.
        
        Another great way to track your progress is to open up the HTML document in your browser and watch how each change you make in the text editor affects the visual layout in the browser.
        
        You can open index.html a few ways, depending on the environment you are in:
        
        For Mac users:
        
        Open from the Terminal by running open index.html in the root directory of this lab
        Use Finder to navigate to this lab's local folder and click the index.html file
        For WSL users:
        
        Open from Ubuntu by running explorer.exe index.html in the root directory of this lab
        Open a new Explorer window. There is a bar that says "Quick Access" along the top of the window (similar to a URL bar in a browser). Click this and type \\wsl$ to access files and folders on Ubuntu. Navigate to /home/<your-user-name>/ to get to your home directory, then locate this lab's local folder and click the index.html file.</p>
